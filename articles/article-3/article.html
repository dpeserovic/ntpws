<h3 class="title title-secondary-news-article">A new wrinkle installed into Curry's summer workouts has pushed the
    sharpshooter toward loftier standards.</h3>
<p>
    SAN FRANCISCO – Sometimes, Stephen Curry shot the ball without taking a dribble. Sometimes he pulled up from deep
    without being balanced. Sometimes he hoisted a shot despite a swarming defender giving him little space to move.
</p>
<p>
    For a player that has cemented himself as the NBA’s best shooter of all time, Curry often shot the ball as if he
    knew it would drop into the basket. He was usually right.
</p>
<p>
    Curry became the primary reason why the Warriors cemented a 115-113 win over the LA Clippers on Thursday at Chase
    Center. He finished with 45 points while shooting 16-of-25 from the field and 8-of-13 from 3-point range, marking
    the 50th time in his 13-year NBA career he had at least 40 points. He made two deep 3s in the final minute,
    including a pull-up from 31 feet and another from 26. And he then made two free throws with 4.7 seconds left to
    secure the win.
</p>
<p>
    Only two days ago following the Warriors’ season-opening win over the Lakers, Curry described his triple-double
    performance as “trash” since he shot 5-of-21 from the field. It did not take long for Curry to turn his trash into
    treasure.
</p>
<p>
    “I never worry about my shot, ever,” Curry said. Why? “Earned confidence with the work you put in,” Curry said. “The
    next shot is always going in.”
</p>
<p>
    The work Curry has put in this past offseason might seem as familiar as any other offseason. He takes plenty of
    shots. But Curry and his trainer, Brandon Payne, detailed to NBA.com a new wrinkle in Curry’s training regimen last
    summer. It has played a factor in Curry climbing to third place for most 45-point games for a player at least 33
    years old (six), trailing only Michael Jordan (11) and Bernard King (eight).
</p>
<p>
    “Making shots in workouts is no longer good enough,” Payne told NBA.com “We’ve established he’s going to make a lot
    of shots in workouts. He consistently does that. So for us, we’ve utilized technology to be even more precise.”
</p>
<p>
    After shattering numerous scoring records and climbing to No. 2 on the NBA’s all-time list for most 3-pointers
    (2,842), Curry relied on shot-tracking technology that determined that not all of his made baskets are created
    equal.
</p>
<p>
    Each time Curry hoisted a shot, the technology tracked the ball’s movement, the ball’s arc and how deep the ball
    went into the rim. If the ball failed to drop through the middle of the rim, Curry and Payne simply counted that
    attempt as a missed shot. Curry and Payne also kept the same standard when he took shots on the move, an approach he
    took to emulate shooting against a swarming defender.

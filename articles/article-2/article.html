<h3 class="title title-secondary-news-article">Did the panel get it right? Wrong? Here's my official ballot.</h3>
<p>
    Seventy-six players were just stamped as the greatest in NBA history. And if you’re now raging, perplexed,
    frustrated or just a little woozy … congrats! You now have a sense of what it was like to be a voter.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, I was one of the 88 people—a mix of media, current and former players, coaches and team executives—who helped
    determine what is officially known as the 75th Anniversary Team. It was an honor, of course. It was also, I must
    tell you, positively torturous. Agonizing. Stressful.
</p>
<p>
    I pestered veteran scribes for advice. I spent a ridiculous number of hours clicking through
    Basketball-Reference.com, and flipping through Bill Simmons’s The Book of Basketball. I set principled standards for
    how the list should be compiled, then scrapped those principled standards. I downed whiskey shots. I lit a candle,
    played John Tesh’s “Roundball Rock” on repeat and summoned the ghost of James Naismith.
</p>
<p>
    It never got any easier. (I’ll lay out my full ballot below.)
</p>
<p>
    Consider this quick thought exercise: Who’s the better player, a) Russell Westbrook or b) Bob Cousy? a) Tracy
    McGrady or b) Jerry Lucas? a) Anthony Davis or b) Dolph Schayes? The three b options—who played primarily in the
    1950s and '60s—were all part of the NBA’s 50th Anniversary Team, back in '96. The three a options played in the
    modern era and were all strong candidates when I started contemplating my ballot for the top 75.
</p>
<p>
    Think about the sheer absurdity of those choices. Westbrook has his faults, but if you borrowed Doc Brown’s DeLorean
    and sent him back in time, he would absolutely demolish the NBA of the 1950s and '60s. (Or, as my NBA Radio
    colleague Zach Harper quipped, “He’d be tried as a witch.”) T-Mac would look like an alien.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine Kevin Durant, a 7-footer with slick handles and a silky jumper, unleashed on the black-and-white era.
    Imagine Damian Lillard pulling up from the logo (albeit for only two points)—not that he’d ever need to, because
    he’d fly past all of these guys.
</p>
<p>
    So let's acknowledge this from the top: It is impossible—absolutely impossible—to fairly compare players across
    seven-plus decades of basketball. Today’s athletes are bigger, stronger, faster, better conditioned and more skilled
    than those even 30 years ago, to say nothing of 70 years ago. The game has changed dramatically.
</p>
<p>
    This entire exercise is fraught on its face. It’s why I always demur on debates about the GOAT, or who would win the
    fantasy battle between the Showtime Lakers and the Splash Brothers Warriors. I just don’t believe there’s an
    objective truth here.

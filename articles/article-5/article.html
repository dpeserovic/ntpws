<h3 class="title title-secondary-news-article">Simmons is the latest N.B.A. star to ask for a trade then try to force
    his way off a team, but Philadelphia is holding firm so far.

</h3>
<p>
    Over the summer, Philadelphia 76ers guard Ben Simmons requested a trade, initiating a standoff that has dragged into
    the regular season.
</p>
<p>
    The organization fined Simmons repeatedly for missing practices, meetings and preseason games, according to ESPN.
    Simmons did not report to the team until near the end of the preseason and was suspended for the regular-season
    opener for conduct detrimental to the team. Simmons likely will not play for the 76ers again for a long while, if
    ever. Philadelphia hosts the Nets on Friday.
</p>
<p>
    In response to a report from The Athletic on Friday that Simmons had said he was mentally unprepared to play, 76ers
    forward Tobias Harris wrote in a tweet: “And we’ll respect his privacy and space during this time. When he’s ready,
    we will embrace our brother with love and handle our business on the court. That’s it, that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
    Here’s how the situation evolved, where it stands and what it could mean for the N.B.A.
</p>
<p>
    Technically, we don’t know. Simmons hasn’t said anything publicly. Much of this has played out through anonymous
    reports in the media. There have been some signals from Simmons’s Instagram page, such as when he liked a post
    detailing how much the Sixers could fine him for missing games and practices.
</p>
<p>
    The tension between Simmons and the Sixers has been festering for years, despite Simmons’s signing an extension in
    2019. Now in his sixth season, he hasn’t really changed much as a player (he missed his first season with a foot
    injury). He is one of the most versatile playmakers in the N.B.A. and an excellent defender, but he has not
    developed a jump shot, which has made him a liability on the offensive end in multiple playoff runs. He’s also a
    career 59.7 percent free-throw shooter, which means teams often foul him on purpose at the end of games.
</p>
<p>
    In December 2019, Brett Brown, the former 76ers coach, publicly begged Simmons to take more 3s. One month later,
    Brown told reporters that he had “failed” in his mission.
</p>
<p>
    Even though Doc Rivers replaced Brown before last season, there hasn’t been much difference. Rivers was Simmons’s
    steadfast defender last year, but after the Atlanta Hawks eliminated the Sixers in the Eastern Conference
    semifinals, Rivers told reporters that he didn’t know whether Simmons could be a point guard for a championship
    team. It’s highly unusual to see a coach publicly criticize his own player minutes after a tough playoff loss.
</p>
<p>
    On Thursday, Daryl Morey, the team’s president of basketball operations, said on a local Philadelphia radio station:
    “Doc Rivers defended Ben Simmons more than any human on Earth, maybe ever. If someone wants to interpret one comment
    out of 10,000, I don’t think that’s very fair to the organization or Doc Rivers.”
</p>
<p>
    He added, “To me, it’s all some sort of like, you know, pretext to do something larger by his agent.”

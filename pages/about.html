    At the NBA, we’re passionate about growing and celebrating the game of basketball. Through the intensity of the game
    and the amazing athletic skill of our players, we deliver excitement to hundreds of millions of fans around the
    world.

    As a global sports and media business, the NBA is so much more. While Basketball Operations runs the league’s
    on-court activities, other departments manage relationships with television and digital media partners, develop
    marketing partnerships with some of the world’s most recognizable companies, oversee the licensing of NBA
    merchandise, and handle a wide range of responsibilities that drive the NBA’s success.

    Off the court, we’re also deeply committed to social responsibility. NBA Cares leads the league’s involvement in
    addressing important social issues by working with internationally recognized youth-serving organizations that
    support education, youth and family development, and health-related causes.

    We do the right thing. We are honest, ethical, and fair – leading by example in sports, culture and society. We’re
    all fans. So we work to provide the same quality of entertainment and experiences that we want for ourselves.
    Basketball is inherently inclusive – anyone can play it. This diversity in people, background and experience is
    central to our success. Our instinct is to innovate. We are relentless in pushing each other’s thinking, shaking up
    the status quo and ensuring bold ideas result in meaningful impact.

    The NBA is a 70-year-old organization born from innovation. It was June 1946 in New York City when Boston Garden
    owner Walter Brown realized that major ice hockey arenas, which were vacant most nights, could be used to host
    basketball games. He established the Basketball Association of America, which in 1949 merged with the National
    Basketball League to create the National Basketball Association.

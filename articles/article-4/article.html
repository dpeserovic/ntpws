    the list.</h3>
<p>
    The NBA officially unveiled its 75th-anniversary best players (consisting of 76 players due to a tie in votes). The
    Crossover staff reveals its biggest snubs, surprises, active players not on the 75th Anniversary Team are most
    likely to make the 100th Anniversary Team and top-five players of all time.
</p>
<p>
    Howard Beck: Full disclosure: I was one of the 88 voters, so I guess I’m 1/88th responsible for any and all
    grievances. That being the case, I’d say the biggest snub is Klay Thompson—the one player I voted for who did not
    make the final list. Thompson is the second-greatest shooter of all time, after Steph Curry. He’s a great defender.
    He’s a three-time champion and was absolutely essential to the Warriors dynasty. I’m astounded that he didn’t make
    it.
</p>
<p>
    Chris Herring: I’d love to come up with a more unique answer, like Alex English or someone like Joe Dumars. But the
    answer is obviously Dwight Howard. It’s mind-blowing that he’s not part of the list.
</p>
<p>
    Michael Pina: Whittling thousands of NBA players down to 75 is next to impossible. But Dwight Howard should be here.
    He’s an eight-time All-Star who cracked eight All-NBA teams and won three Defensive Player of the Year trophies.
    Howard leads all active players in blocks and rebounds and was easily the most dominant two-way center in the entire
    league throughout his prime, which nearly lasted a decade. (He finished top-five for MVP four times.) This omission
    is hard to comprehend.
</p>
<p>
    Rohan Nadkarni: The biggest snub has to be Dwight Howard, who I think is more accomplished than his current teammate
    Anthony Davis, who made the list. For all his antics, Howard is a surefire Hall of Famer. He was the league’s most
    dominant center and defensive player for years. Dwight has eight All-Star appearances, eight All-NBAs, and three
    DPOYs. It’s hard to justify leaving him off this list for what he’s done on the court. I blame Howard Beck for
    letting this happen.
</p>
<p>
    Jeremy Woo: It’s hard to pick just one, and I don’t think it’s worth making a stink, but at a glance, I’d argue
    strongly for Derrick Rose, Manu Ginóbili, Tony Parker and Pau Gasol. Injuries obviously scuttled what would have
    been an obvious case for Rose, and he and Nikola Jokić are the only two MVP winners not to make the list. An
    injury-riddled prime and short peak didn’t keep Bill Walton off the list. It’s extremely hard for me to believe Tim
    Duncan should be the only player from the later era of Spurs title teams on the list, particularly when you consider
    the sheer number of guys from the various Celtics dynasties of yore who made the cut. Manu and Parker are both
    deserving. You can argue the same for Gasol, who was a multiple-time champion with longevity. It was the right thing
    to do to preserve the sanctity of the original top 50 (and I’m too young to really have strong takes on the older
    guys), but if the goal had been to relitigate the entire thing in earnest, this list looks different, I think.
</p>
<p>
    Beck: That Dwight Howard didn’t make it. I didn’t vote for him, but I thought most others would. I’m also surprised
    the entire 50th Anniversary Team made it on the 75th-anniversary list. I thought for sure that one or two old-timers
    would get cut in favor of more current stars.
</p>
<p>
    Herring: Anthony Davis. The body of work is undeniable, but seeing him on the list, but not Dwight, makes me wonder
    just how much Davis benefited from winning the title alongside LeBron James. Howard never won it as a star but was
    largely responsible for giving his team a chance to earn a ring. Davis has always been fantastic but was never able
    to single-handedly carry his club the way a prime Howard did.
</p>
<p>
    Pina: For some reason I wasn’t expecting some of the active players to make it, being that their careers remain
    unsettled. Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard are deserving, but what separates them from Nikola Jokić (an MVP
    winner), Paul George, Klay Thompson and Jimmy Butler? Or the likes of Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter and Tony Parker?
